# Service brief summary report

## Purpose

Aggregate service brief markdown files into a single summary report that highlights
common headings, CTAs, and schema types across pages.

## Inputs

- Service brief files in `data/outputs/<client-slug>/reports/service-briefs/*.md`.
- Each brief should include the sections generated by the service brief template
  (page structure, CTAs, internal links, schema, FAQs).

## Command

```bash
python scripts/generators/brief_summary_report.py --client-slug <client-slug>
```

## Outputs

- `data/outputs/<client-slug>/reports/service-briefs-summary.md`
- `data/outputs/<client-slug>/reports/service-briefs-summary.json`

## Notes

- The report aggregates counts for headings, CTA text, and schema types.
- If a brief omits a section, it is reported as empty in the per-page snapshot.
