## Summary

Added a docs/seo index linking measurement spec and templates.

## Context

Provide a quick entry point for reusable SEO measurement docs.

## Scope

Add @docs/seo/README.md linking measurement spec, intake, and reporting templates.

## Risks

Risk: minimal; index only.

## Verify Steps

1) Confirm @docs/seo/README.md exists. 2) Validate links point to measurement spec and templates.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the commit that adds the docs/seo README.

## Notes

Index is intentionally short for quick onboarding.
