## Summary

Tracked completion of swarm roles plus webpage and article templates for HighPoint HVAC local SEO.

## Context

HighPoint HVAC local SEO swarm needed roles plus reusable webpage and article templates.

## Scope

Deliver swarm roles spec and initial webpage + article templates with schema requirements and analytics placeholders.

## Risks

Risk: templates remain generic until HighPoint HVAC inputs are provided. Mitigation: placeholders and guardrails enforce approved sources.

## Verify Steps

1) Review roles doc and templates for completeness. 2) Confirm schema requirement and rank tracking inputs are present.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the commits that added roles and template docs.

## Notes
