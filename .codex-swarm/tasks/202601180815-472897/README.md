# 202601180815-472897: Add logo image + geocoding to schema entities

## Summary

- Enrich `Organization` and `LocalBusiness` schema with address data, a logo image, and `geo` coordinates (when available).

## Context

- Basic business schema is more useful when it includes a consistent identifier set: name, url, address, and a representative image/logo.
- Geocoding can be sourced from a cached lookup file to avoid repeated external calls and to work offline.

## Scope

- `scripts/cache_schema_generator.py` extracts a logo URL from the homepage and assigns it as `image` on `Organization` and `LocalBusiness`.
- `scripts/cache_schema_generator.py` loads cached geocodes from `outputs/<client>/reports/geocoded.json` and assigns `LocalBusiness.geo` when present (with optional `geopy` lookup via `--geocode`).

## Risks

- Geocoding may be unavailable offline or without `geopy`; generator should degrade gracefully and omit `geo` rather than failing.

## Verify Steps

- `python3 scripts/cache_schema_generator.py --client-slug highpoint-hvac --output-dir /tmp/schema-smoke-472897`
- Confirm `/tmp/schema-smoke-472897/index.html` includes `Organization.image`, `LocalBusiness.image`, `Organization.address`, and `LocalBusiness.geo` (when cached geocode exists).

## Rollback Plan

- Revert the commit for this task and regenerate; confirm schema entities no longer include `image`/`geo` enrichment.

## Notes

- Keep geocode caching under `outputs/<client>/reports/geocoded.json` so runs can remain deterministic and offline-friendly.
