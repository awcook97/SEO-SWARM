## Summary

Created HighPoint HVAC draft deliverables for pages, articles/blog, social posts, and subscriber email using the templates.

## Context

Deliver a full-service content package for HighPoint HVAC based on existing templates.

## Scope

Add HighPoint HVAC drafts for local landing page, service page, service-area article, topical blog post, social posts, and subscriber email under @outputs/highpoint-hvac/.

## Risks

Risk: drafts include placeholders and cannot be published without approved inputs. Mitigation: require input completion from outputs/highpoint-hvac/inputs.md.

## Verify Steps

1) Confirm outputs/highpoint-hvac includes pages, articles, social, and email drafts. 2) Ensure schema is included in page and article drafts.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the commit that adds outputs/highpoint-hvac/ content.

## Notes

Drafts are placeholder-based to avoid unverified claims.
