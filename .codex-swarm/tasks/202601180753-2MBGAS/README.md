# 202601180753-2MBGAS: Refine schema types + per-service offers

## Summary

- Use `HVACBusiness` (alongside `LocalBusiness`) for the business entity and emit per-page offers via `makesOffer`.
- Limit `makesOffer` to the matching service on service pages, while allowing the homepage to list all services.

## Context

- Large “serviceOffered” lists on every page can be noisy; limiting offers to relevant pages improves parity with on-page intent and reviewability.

## Scope

- `scripts/cache_schema_generator.py` uses `@type: ["HVACBusiness","LocalBusiness"]` for the business entity.
- Replace broad `serviceOffered` usage with `makesOffer` and match offers to service page URLs via slug-based matching.

## Risks

- Offer matching is heuristic (slug containment). If URLs or service names change, offers may not attach as expected.

## Verify Steps

- `python3 scripts/cache_schema_generator.py --client-slug highpoint-hvac --output-dir /tmp/schema-smoke-2mbgas`
- Confirm `/tmp/schema-smoke-2mbgas/index.html` includes all service offers, while `/tmp/schema-smoke-2mbgas/air-duct-services.html` includes only `Air Duct Services`.

## Rollback Plan

- Revert the commit for this task and regenerate the same sample; compare `LocalBusiness.makesOffer` behavior on homepage vs service pages.

## Notes

- Keep offers limited to what is supported by approved inputs (`outputs/<client>/inputs.md` or GBP checklist).
