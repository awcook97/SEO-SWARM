## Summary

Created service-area landing and topical HVAC article templates with SEO structure, metadata, and compliance notes.

## Context

Article templates guide service-area and topical SEO content for HighPoint HVAC.

## Scope

Add @docs/highpoint-hvac/article-templates.md with service-area landing and topical guide templates, including metadata and compliance notes.

## Risks

Risk: articles may introduce unverified local or performance claims. Mitigation: placeholders and explicit compliance notes tied to approved sources.

## Verify Steps

1) Confirm @docs/highpoint-hvac/article-templates.md exists. 2) Review service-area vs topical template structure and metadata guidance.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the commit that adds the article template doc.

## Notes

Templates require approved sources for claims and constrain local references to verified service areas.
