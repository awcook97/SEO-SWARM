description: "Add outputs/ to .gitignore so client-specific artifacts are excluded from git."
---
## Summary

Ignored client output folders to keep repository publishable.

## Context

Client-specific outputs should not be committed when publishing to GitHub.

## Scope

Add outputs/ to @.gitignore to exclude client artifacts.

## Risks

Risk: none; ignores only client outputs.

## Verify Steps

1) Confirm outputs/ is listed in .gitignore. 2) Ensure no other ignore rules were changed.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the commit that updates .gitignore.

## Notes

If you want to keep a placeholder folder in git, add a .gitkeep and adjust ignore rules accordingly.
