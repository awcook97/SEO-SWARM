## Summary

Created local landing page and service page templates for HighPoint HVAC with SEO structure, metadata, and compliance guardrails.

## Context

Webpage templates will guide local SEO landing pages and core service pages for HighPoint HVAC.

## Scope

Add @docs/highpoint-hvac/webpage-templates.md with templates for local landing pages and service pages, including metadata and internal linking guidance.

## Risks

Risk: templates could imply unverified claims or pricing. Mitigation: placeholders and explicit compliance notes requiring approved inputs.

## Verify Steps

1) Confirm @docs/highpoint-hvac/webpage-templates.md exists. 2) Review landing vs service template coverage and metadata guidance.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the commit that adds the webpage template doc.

## Notes

Templates use placeholders and require verified sources for all factual claims.
