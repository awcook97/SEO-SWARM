## Summary

Enhance the schema-to-inputs scaffold to parse @graph nodes and richer business fields.

## Scope

- Support @graph and nested nodes when extracting name, URL, and description.
- Extract hours, areas served, services, social profiles, price range, and payments when available.
- Update tests to cover @graph-based schemas.

## Risks

- Schema variants may still omit fields; placeholders remain where data is missing.

## Verify Steps

- Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (passes).

## Rollback Plan

- Revert updates to `scripts/inputs_from_schema.py` and related tests.
